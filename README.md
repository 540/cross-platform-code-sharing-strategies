## Run examples
For each project example:

- `yarn install`: installs dependencies

- `yarn mobile`: starts mobile bundler
- `yarn android`: installs & runs app on android
- `yarn ios`: installs & runs app on iOS
- `yarn test`: runs tests


## Shared logic and view

### [Shared code with RNWeb](https://github.com/540/cross-platform-code-sharing-strategies/tree/master/shared-code-with-uikit-bridge)
[React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) is a compatibility layer between React DOM and React Native. It allows you to build ios, android and web apps from React Native api and components.

### [Shared code wiith UIKit bridge](https://github.com/540/cross-platform-code-sharing-strategies/tree/master/shared-code-with-uikit-bridge)
Another option is to define a custom UIkit that works as a bridge and create an implementation for each platform.

## Shared logic, different view

### [Isolated fronts shared core](https://github.com/540/cross-platform-code-sharing-strategies/tree/master/isolated-fronts-shared-core)
In this example, we shared the core written in JS and each platform implements his own view.
